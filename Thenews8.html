With a high of 78 and a low of 66. It is sunny with a chance of rain. </span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c1">STORY TIME</span></p><p class="c15"><span class="c14">CHAPTER 2 THE ARCHIVE</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c10">The archives hold all of the history of magic and how to beat the super dragon but how do we find it? It was hidden long ago. Well I have a clue it is a map to the archives but it is a long and treacherous path. First along the line is the serpent dragon, the most powerful dragon ever. Second is the sea of mist a sea full of dark mist that monsters hide in third rebug a big super spider that has a web as strong as graphene the strongest thing ever last but not least robod a super strong AI with</span><span class="c16">&nbsp;</span><span class="c10">the power to shoot lasers out of its eyes.But so why don&#39;t we just face them up against each other? because they are banished to the path to guard the archives.The next day a group of wizards set out a few hours later they saw a pool of drool. one wizard stepped in it. It was so sticky that the wizard had to use an evaporating spell but suddenly a snort was heard and a towering dragon rose from the muck it had a head of a snake in fact three heads of a snake and the body of a dragon they used a spell of shattering it bounced off the dragons scales weakening them then concentrating on one spot they used a paralyzing spell and the dragon fell down paralized .The next day they were shrouded in darkness but but it was the middle of the day they had reached the sea of mist. one heard a growling and a demon dog jumped out of nowhere it was blasted instantly but the growling didn&#39;t stop? Suddenly a giant chest jumped out of the blue and they all used an exploding spell and the chest was blasted to bits but when they looked closer there was a sword and </span><span class="c14">&nbsp; I can cut through anything</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;.was carved into the sword . What does this mean ? It means we have found the invincible blade now we shall go to rebug. Very soon the mist cleared and the sun seemed to have lines running all over it and the ground was all sticky and dragon bodys were lying here and there and suddenly a web was shot one inch above their heads they had found rebug !Slash him with the sword then we will be able to hit him with spells. One person slashed at the under belly and rebug dropped to the ground. It turns out that the sword was covered in acid. That was awfully easy and suddenly a spider ten times as big as the first one I am REBUG !!!!!! see this is why we don&#39;t say this is too easy. First they tried to slash rebug but he shot a web on the sword and the web was instantly vaporized. So they kept going and finally hit rebug . rebug hissed in pain and collapsed and said</span><span class="c12">&nbsp;you can pass through my land. </span><span class="c0">Next they passed Through the main web and came out into the light but they heard crackles of electricity and there was robod. He was at least 20 stories tall!!! He zapped lasers out of his eyes and the ground before them erupted in flames.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c10">&nbsp; So they used an eroding spell and the meatal was rusted</span><span class="c12">&nbsp; </span><span class="c0">so they could destroy the robot&#39;s hull.They shot a spell of destruction and the robot&rsquo;s armor and it cracked a bit. We have to use more destruction spells!!! So they shot a bunch of destruction spells at the robot and finally the robot was destroyed! The next day they got into the temple and there were the archives!!!!!!</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p></body></html>
