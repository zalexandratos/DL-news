##### THE SUPER DRAGONâ„¢
                                        CHAPTER 1 THE DRAGON
Once upon a time there was a tribe of wizards called the dragon clan. They got the name because of their yearly production of dragon hide and meat. One day though they went to the cave and found a SUPER DRAGON!!! It was five times as large as a regular dragon. Only one wizard escaped, he told the tribe and then they all screamed. The whole reason they hunted dragons was because a time long ago they had faced one  so they put up all of the defenses but soon the next day a wizard came he looked like he had just ran through a wall of dirt "I bring troubling news, the outer defenses had been breached!" he said and sure enough they saw a looming cloud of dust they set up the teleporter and just in time the super dragon was at the capital of the magic empire in a day. everybody was teleported out of the city into magic jungle the magic jungle was safe because of the superbugs bugs so powerful one can take a dragon 10 can take a super dragon. But when they got there something was not right. Where was the settlement? Suddenly a powerful roar was heard. They went to the top of the tree and there was the super dragon. It looked much bigger up here and 20 superbugs were already fighting. Then they saw the settlement was destroyed. They heard a boom and all the superbugs went flying. We have to find the archives!
